After learning HTML and CSS for about two weeks now, I'v managed to create a Photo portfolio on my own. 
I know its not much, but i'm proud of this project. Thinking two weeks back where I didn't know anything 
about coding (CSS & HTML), I must say I think I did qite good. 
The fun of building Websites makes me want to learn more about Coding an Webdevelopment. 

Tank You !
